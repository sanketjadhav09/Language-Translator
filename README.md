## Libraries Used

- `googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`: A Python library that provides an interface to the Google Translate API.
- `Python`: The programming language used to implement this project.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanketjadhav09/Language-Translator.git
   cd translator-project
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

   pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
   ```

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   Language_Translator.ipynb
   ```

## How to Use

1. After running `Language_Translator.ipynb`, the program will prompt you to enter the text you wish to translate.
2. You will then be asked to provide the target language code (e.g., 'mr' for Marathi, 'hi' for hindi).
3. The program will display the original text, the translated text, and the language it was translated to.

## Project Structure

- `Language_Translator.ipynb`: Main Python script handling user input, translation request, and output display.
- `README.md`: This file, containing instructions and project details.
- `Output.png`: A screenshot of the translator in action.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user is prompted to input text and specify the target language code.
2. **API Call**: The program sends the input to the Google Translate API, requesting a translation.
3. **Output**: The program displays the translated text and language information.
